This is a sample XCode iOS Template. It basically creates a single framework application, with some default classes and methods that allow you to quickly test any development ideas you have.

Also the man purpose of this is to show what needs to be done to create a XCode iOS Template of your own.

Tested only with XCode 4.2

Place Template In Folder:

~/Library/Developer/XCode/Templates/Project Templates/

(Note: Templates directory may not by on your system by default. You may have to create it)

The key part to making your own template is to get the TemplateInfo.plist file done correctly, otherwise you will see things go wrong :)
